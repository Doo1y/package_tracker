# PACKAGE TRACKER APP

## This project consists of...

- A package tracking page that allows a user to select a package and view its progress from city to city.
- A form allowing a user to enter the details to ship a new package.
- A page that allows a user to see all of their packages, and the current status of that package.
- A navigation tool that allows the simulation of the passage of time.
- A database that stores the status of each package.
  (Optional)
- A login page that allows multiple users to individually add and track their packages.
